/*
Hoisting: Is a javascript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved 
to the top of their scope before code execution

-------------
Usages of var 
-------------
var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped. This means that a variable
that is declared with "var" outside a function block is available for use in the whole window.
"var" is function scoped when is declared within a function.

-------------
Usages of let
-------------
let is prefered for variable declaration now

---------------
Usages of const
---------------
Variables declared with const maintain constant values. const declarations share some similarities
with let declarations.

const declarations are block scoped
